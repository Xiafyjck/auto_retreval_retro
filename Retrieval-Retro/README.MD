### Overview
While inorganic retrosynthesis planning is essential in the field of chemical science, the application of machine learning in this area has been notably less explored compared to organic retrosynthesis planning. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Retro for inorganic retrosynthesis planning, which implicitly extracts the precursor information of reference materials that are retrieved from the knowledge base regarding domain expertise in the field. Specifically, instead of directly employing the precursor information of reference materials, we propose implicitly extracting it with various attention layers, which enables the model to learn novel synthesis recipes more effectively. Moreover, during retrieval, we consider the thermodynamic relationship between target material and precursors, which is essential domain expertise in identifying the most probable precursor set among various options. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Retrieval-Retro in
retrosynthesis planning, especially in discovering novel synthesis recipes, which is crucial for materials discovery.

#### Dataset
You can dowload the year split dataset in this drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hDCVjT50au_f5fVeZxF_4U2nF6GmhO74?usp=sharing)  
After downloading the dataset, place it in the `dataset` folder  
(We upload our dataset into the drive link due to its file size)

#### Run model
Run `main_Retrieval_Retro.py` to train our Retrieval-Retro (after downloading the dataset)

### Models
#### Retrieval-Retro
`Retrieval_Retro.py`: Our proposed model: Retrieval-Retro

### Others
#### MPC
`MPC.py`: MPC Retriever  
`train_mpc.py`: For training MPC Retriever  
`retrieval_mpc.py`: For calculating the cosine similarity and saving top-k retrieved materials from the MPC retriever  
`utils_mpc.py`: utils for MPC Retriever training  

#### NRE
`GraphNetwork.py`: Formation Energy predictor GraphNetwork & GraphNetwork backbone  
`pretrain_nre.py`: For training NRE Retriever (Formation Energy predictor)
